# Is it bannable?
No, ROBLOX fully allows custom textures and it is not bannable.

# Why is this triggering my antivirus?
There's multiple reasons why your antivirus may trigger it. 1) This tampers with roblox's files changing the textures so the antivirus detects that something is being tampered with roblox and it sends you a warning. 2) This may trigger your antivirus as not alot of people have downloaded this making it trigger the antivirus (400/10,000 need to download this for antivirus to flag it as safe.) 

# Is this safe to use
Yes, over 400 people use our custom textures.

# Enjoy using!
